List of concepts that I had answer wrong when I am taking tests.


* **NetFlow** is a network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network flow. By analyzing NetFlow data, you can get a picture of network traffic flow and volume. Netflow is a Cisco propietary solition to monitor traffic thst psddrd through s router.
  
* **Geo-tagging** Verify whether the application is using any geo-tagging features that store geographical identifying information with media such as photos or video. This could be a privacy concern, as physical location could be determined from this geo-
tagged data.

## Backups
* **Full backups** back up every file that is selected and then clear the archive bit. necessitates a large storage capacity and a lot of time.
*  **Incremental backups** back up any files that have changed and then clear the archive bit so that the next backup will not back the file up (unless you do a full backup).
*  **Differential backups** back up any files that have had changes but do not clear the archive bit. Because the archive bit is not cleared, each differential backup will back up all files changed since the last full backup.
